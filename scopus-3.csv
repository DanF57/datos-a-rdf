This factor affects an individual's ability to react efficiently to an action known as resilience to disasters caused by natural phenomena or catastrophes that involve human participation. This study proposes a method for detecting vulnerabilities in urban road systems in large, intermediate, and small cities in Latin America, so that resilience can be better supported. Depending on the structural characteristics of a city, measurement techniques can be used to combine the topological, geographic, and spatiotemporal indicators. Several measurements, such as mesh and connectivity, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, robustness of networks with interruption attacks, location of dead ends, measurement of travel times between origin and destination, elevations and fusion of indicators with clusters on the same map, were applied using network graphs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to estimate the resilience of road networks. The results are exposed to clusters of fused geospatial maps, which show that intersections and streets tend to be classified as vulnerable, with morphological structures of growth, resistance to degradation of the urban network, marginal urban sectors with high conglomeration, and mobility. The results highlight the importance of applying resilient practices in the region and generating urban management options to strengthen the response capacity of cities in Latin America. © 2013 IEEE.","indicator fusion; Resilience; road networks","Disasters; MESH networking; Motor transportation; Travel time; Urban growth; Geographic areas; Indicator fusion; Latin America; Latin americans; Networks/graphs; Resilience; Road; Road network; Urban areas; Roads and streets","Universidad Católica de Cuenca, (2022/231)","This work was supported by the Universidad Católica de Cuenca under Grant 2022/231.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135759295"

CR system actively engaged in the data sensing, learning and dynamic adjustment of radio spectrum parameters with management of unused spectrum in the signal. The spectrum sensing is indispensable in the CR for the management of Primary Users (PUs) and Secondary users (SUs) without any interference. Spectrum sensing is considered as the effective adaptive signal processing model to evaluate the computational complexity model for the signal transmission through Matched filtering, Waveform and Cyclostationary based Energy sensing model. Cyclostationary based model is effective for the energy based sensing model based on unique characteristics with estimation of available channel in the spectrum to extract the received signal in the PU signal. Cyclostationary based model uses the spectrum availability without any periodic property to extract the noise features. This paper developed a Adaptive Cross Score Cyclostationary (ACSCS) to evaluate the spectrum sensing in the CR network. The developed ACSCS model uses the computational complexity with estimation of Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) elimination of cost function. ACSCS model uses the Adaptive Least square Spectral Self-Coherence Restoral (SCORE) with the Adaptive Cross Score (ACS) to overcome the issues in CR. With the derived ACSCS algorithm minimizes the computational complexity based on cost function compared with the ACS algorithm. To minimize the computational complexity pipeline triangular array based Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) structure for the optimization of network. The simulation performance analysis with the ACSCS scheme uses the Rician Multipath Fading channel to estimate detection probability to sense the Receiver Operating Characteristics, detection probability and probability of false alarm using Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector. The ACSC model uses the Square-law combining (SLC) with the moment generation function in the multipath fading channel for the channel sensing with reduced computational complexity. The simulation analysis expressed that ACSC scheme achieves the maximal detection probability value of 1. The analysis expressed that proposed ACSC scheme achieves the improved channel estimation in the 4G communication environment. © 2022 Kohat University of Science and Technology.

Given the weathering, intensified by its geographic location, this monument presents a high level of deterioration despite much previous research and the execution of conservation actions. Therefore, this research proposes a comprehensive study that relates the deterioration processes of the Elliptical Wall and the climate conditions where it is located. The method of wall stratigraphic reading has been used, complemented by an analysis of condensation and solar gain. The results show that the building comprises nine phases, four in common for all the orientations from 700 AD, which define the property's authenticity, and five characterized by diverse interventions. At least 38 construction, reconstruction, and maintenance activities have been identified in 9 historical-construction phases and ten degradation phases. In addition, all the orientations of the Elliptical Wall reach the dew point at night, given the relative humidity and air temperature levels in the study region. The southern orientation stands out as the surface with the highest frequency of condensation, the lowest solar gain, and the highest percentage of affections. Thus, this study supports that the deterioration of this building has a high correlation with its condensation capacity, which intensifies or reduces depending on the levels of solar capture; the monument will continue to be transformed and even eliminate historic strata due to the irreversible deterioration in different sectors and the current difficulties in mitigating it. © 2023, The Author(s).","Condensation; Elliptical wall; Heritage damage; Historical–constructive analysis; Ingapirca Sun Temple; Solar radiation","","Biodeterioro del Complejo Arqueológico Ingapirca; INPC; Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural; Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE, (PICCIITT19-21)","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Universidad Católica de Cuenca within the research project No. PICCIITT19-21 called Biodeterioration of the Ingapirca Archaeological Complex: microbiology and lichenology of stone substrates (Biodeterioro del Complejo Arqueológico Ingapirca; microbiología y liquenología de sustratos pétreos, in Spanish).

As first step, a pre-processing is applied to dataset collected between 2019 and 2021, which was provided by Metropolitan Network of Atmospheric Monitoring of Quito. For this, a variance inflation factor is used to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables to reduce the input parameters considering their statistical significance. The proposed models were trained to predict PM2.5 concentrations up to 24 h in advance. The experimental results of the proposed models using time windows of 6, 12 and 24 h show that the transformer model obtains better performance, mainly, if the model is trained using a time windows of 24 h. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention modules; Long-Short Term Memory; Multi-Layer Perceptron; PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations; Transformer; Urban air pollution","Air pollution; Brain; Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Regression analysis; Ambient air; Attention module; Multilayers perceptrons; Performance; PM 2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Time windows; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Urban air pollution; Long short-term memory","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175961273"

This makes it a country with high potential for the use of renewable and clean energies. Here is exposed as a case study the city of Cuenca that receives constant solar radiation and without significant variations throughout the year. This research consists of the development of a measurement system to obtain the average radiation, through the installation of photovoltaic solar panels on a mobile unit (vehicle) for the analysis of radiation in transport trajectories in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. The system is capable of performing radiation profiling in a database. This will allow to record accurate information to design mobile solar installations taking into account the incidence of solar radiation on a photovoltaic panel installed on vehicles. This study allows to have a real conception of the opportunities of the implementation of photovoltaic panels on vehicles. Existing studies consider only fixed panels on buildings, but as evidenced in this study, having panels moving on the streets of the city, the situation is different from the above mentioned.

At present, in the world there are automatic or intelligent water consumption measurement systems, which are very expensive to implement. Also, there are still analog metering systems that are still installed in third world countries because of their cost, and they have not reached their useful life. The intention of reducing errors in analog systems is based on a meta-analytical study, which allows to relate the current reality of the data collection methodology with the effectiveness of automatic systems, in order to establish a hybrid solution that allows the use of analog meters but that reading errors are reduced by implementing technology. To achieve this, we proceeded to design a reading system using mobile devices and QR code tags that were placed on each analog meter in the city of Cañar. With the implementation of this pilot plan, the costs of migrating to a smart metering system have been reduced, which didn’t affect the users or the institution in charge of water distribution. There has been a positive response from users since errors caused by human intervention in the collection of information have been reduced by 99%. At the same time, the institution has better control of the personnel who carry out the reading, which ensures that the data obtained are real and reliable. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Residential water management; Smart metering; Water meter; Water utility","","Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador; Information Technology Department of the Municipality of Cañar; Sistemas Embebidos y Visión Artificial en Ciencias Arquitectónicas, Agropuecuarias, Ambientales y Automática","Funding text 1: The information provided for this research is for public use and is supported by the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador and the Organic Law of Transparency and Access to Public Information (LOTAIP), and is found in the files of the potable water department, as well as in the financial department of the Municipality of the city of Cañar.

At present, academic institutions face challenges associated with how to access vast amounts of information in an efficient manner. This problem is compounded by the increasing number of academic documents available, the dispersion of information in different repositories, and the time and resources required to search and filter this information, which represents a significant workload for professors and students.

To address this issue, surrogate modeling reduces the dimensionality of such problems, enabling less processor-consuming solutions. One method within surrogate modeling is the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, which allows the decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model with intermittent forcing. However, the application of this approach in the field of control systems, particularly within the framework of fault-tolerant control systems, still needs to be explored. This paper aims to present a systematic review of the literature on surrogate modeling applied to control systems, focusing on three specific inquiries. First, the study investigates the surrogate modeling methods commonly used in fault detection and diagnosis. Second, it explores the surrogate modeling methods predominantly utilized in describing chaotic phenomena and dynamical systems. Lastly, the paper explores the potential of applying the HAVOK method to control and model system faults. A comprehensive search yielded 75 relevant articles published in the last five years. From this pool, 12 articles were selected for review. The findings revealed that the full implementation of the HAVOK method in control and fault prediction has not yet been realized. © 2023 IEEE.","chaotic systems; control systems; dynamical systems; fault detection; Hankel; HAVOK; Koopman; surrogate modeling; System modeling","Chaotic systems; Control systems; Approximate modeling; Faults detection; Hankel; Hankel alternative view of koopman; Koopman; Model method; Real-world problem; Surrogate modeling; System models; Systematic Review; Fault detection","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186758189"

Detailed analyses were performed for heating and hot water preparation in two scenarios with different conditions (standard and fully integrated). From a technical perspective, different strategies were analyzed to ensure its functionality. If the photovoltaic system is sized to achieve advanced control, the system can even operate autonomously. However, due to the need to guarantee the energy efficiency of the center, the analyses were performed with a grid connection, and it was determined that the photovoltaic system guarantees at least two-thirds of the energy required for its autonomous operation.

Firstly, the BoM of ten buildings of every decade was obtained through field work carried out in three urban sectors of this city. Secondly, the specific embodied energy and specific weight of every material found in the 40 samples were obtained by bibliography. Finally, the calculation of each building was divided into three components: Structure, Envelope and Finishes. The analyzed data show a detailed collection of different materials and construction typologies used in these four decades, and the impact on their embodied energy and their weight. Moreover, this article gives a Specific Embodied Energy and Specific Weight database of 25 materials that are extensively used in Andean regions. The results show several changes in reference to the insertion of new material, but also regarding the adoption of new architectonic models. The most important changes, in the analyzed period, have been the use of concrete and metal in the structure instead of wood, the increase in the glass surface in the envelope, and the replacement of wood by particleboard on the finishes. In conclusion, the STEE of the entire building has experienced an increase of 2.19 times in the last four decades. The STW value has also increased, but to a lesser extent (1.36 times).

Ac-curate AQI prediction is critical for mitigating the significant health impacts of air pollution and plays a vital role in public health protection and environmental management. The research compares traditional RNN models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, with advanced Transformer architectures. Data were collected from a weather station in Cuenca, Ecuador, focusing on key pollutants such as CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and SO2. Model performance was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2). The findings reveal that the LSTM model achieved superior performance, with an R2 of 0.701, an RMSE of 0.087, and an MAE of 0.056, demonstrating superior capability in capturing temporal dependencies within complex datasets. Conversely, while Transformer-based models exhibited potential, they were less effective in handling intricate time-series data, resulting in comparatively lower accuracy. These results position the LSTM model as the most reliable approach for AQI prediction, offering an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

This customization allows remote operation of the robot’s movements and an additional level of autonomy for the displacements in previously known locations. One of several teleoperations methods is the direct teleoperations method, which is used in master–slave control mode via a wireless network. Next, the article focuses on proposing a validation methodology for social robot applications design. Under this approach, two tests are performed to validate the designed application. The first one seeks to find the response speed of the communication between the robot and the mobile device wherein 10 devices with different characteristics and capabilities are used. This test is critical since a delay outside the allowable range invalidates the use of the application.

It must be managed sustainably to avoid the depletion of natural resources, minimize risks to human health, reduce environmental burdens, and maintain an overall balance in the ecosystem. This research focuses on the anaerobic digestion of bovine and swine excreta with and without applying beneficial microorganisms as a viable option for recycling agricultural solid wastes. Three greenhouse gases (GHGs)—methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia—produced by cattle and swine excreta that were treated with and without beneficial microorganisms in bioreactors were quantified. A monitoring and gas concentration measurement system was implemented inside the bioreactors. The behavior of the GHGs and the efficiency of the beneficial microorganisms in treating the farm animal waste were analyzed according to the phases of anaerobic digestion. Average reductions in the concentration in units of ppm of CH4 during the composting process of 46.95% and 34.48% were observed for the cattle and swine excreta treatments, respectively. It was concluded that the studied GHGs had different behaviors in the anaerobic digestion of the treatments in cattle and swine excreta with and without beneficial microorganisms due to the different types of feeding. However, it must be emphasized that beneficial microorganisms are an essential tool for reducing GHGs in anaerobic digestion. © 2023 by the authors.","anaerobic digestion; electrochemical and electronic sensors; excreta treatment; microbial consortium","anaerobic digestion; cattle; electrochemical method; excretion; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; pig; sensor","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156120046"

The general conclusion is that regardless of the accessibility to learning that exist in our countries, the important thing is the knowledge that remains, if this is really effective, if the teacher do the class online with the available applications, and also if he has all the technological resources, to teach the class and not only to send the weekly planning of the assignment either by mail, messaging or web platforms, without an evaluation to verify that the student has learned and passed the class or subject  © 2021 IEEE.","accessibility; education; internet; platform; virtual","Diseases; E-learning; Engineering education; Bibliographic reviews; Distance-learning; Effective distance; Information and Communication Technologies; Platform; Research methodologies; South America; Teachers'; Technological resources; Virtual; SARS","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119457836"

These onyx-travertines are commonly used for decorative purposes in buildings in the Historic Center of Santa Ana de los Ríos de Cuenca. The aim of this work was to characterize these stones and determine the variation of their physico-mechanical properties, such as mass loss and water absorption, after being subjected to four durability tests: salt crystallization (S-C), freeze–thaw (F-T), thermal shock (T-S) and acid attack (A-A). In addition, Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analyses were carried out to record weathering patterns and understand the deterioration mechanism. Results show that these stones’ sedimentary structure is stratified. Two specimens exhibit geometrical features consistent with porous laminated facies and the remaining two have slightly porous cryptolaminated ones. Facies’ structure orientation is also found to determine mechanical strength, exhibiting the normal to lamination orientation the lowest value. As for durability, the statistical interpretation of the results suggests that the level of severity of each test follows S-C > F–T > A-A > T-S. In addition, laminated facies are more vulnerable to accelerated aging tests. Impact of S-C, F–T and T-S tests is mainly explained by differences in porosity and damage produced by A-A is related to the available effective area for the reaction to take place. Thus, the onyx-travertine is more than a wonderful material, it represents an interesting case study for development of future research on heritage stone in Ecuador and the world by employing normalized tests that are rarely used or published. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accelerated aging; Acid attack; Capillarity; Freezing–thawing; Onyx-travertine; Porosity; Salt crystallization; Thermal shock","","Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural; Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Católica de Cuenca (Ecuador) and the Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural (Ecuador) for providing analytical instruments and facilities for the development of this article and the research project in general.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142937065"

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which are a kind of evolution on e-learning, have the endorsement of prestigious universities around the world, and are transforming the traditional teaching–learning process. In Ecuador, these online courses are based on the Basic General Education system and are neither popular among students nor widely used by teachers in their teaching method, thus, this teaching system is not considered as an official qualification. The inclusion of this tool in the Ecuadorian educational system as a learning resource would expand access to equal opportunities to students and teachers from all over the country. Therefore, our proposal is to use the MOOCs as a source with all the instructional contents of the subject and as classwork based on the flipped-classroom method. In this way, such resources can be an aid to traditional high school classes, and the average grade achieved by students through this platform, as well as the student’s participation, may be part of the formal evaluation system in any institution. With the purpose of measuring the level of confidence in online education and the usage of MOOCs as a tool for teachers’ work, a descriptive and analytical approach has been taken in this study. A quantitative survey was administered to 696 Basic General Education teachers who took used this type of course. The results of this investigation show that 93.9% of the teachers trust the online education; 89% are ready to use MOOCs as a teaching–learning resource and 79% would use MOOCs as part of the final grade. These data prove that MOOCs could be a complementary tool for Basic General Education in Ecuador, so they could contribute to improve learning outcomes and the development of traditional education. © 2022 by the authors.","equality of opportunities; flipped classroom; high school education; MOOC","Ecuador; education; globalization; learning; observational method; psychology; survey method; teaching","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142670427"

However, the involvement of impaired alpha (α) cell function has been recognized as playing an essential role in several diseases, since hyperglucagonemia has been evidenced in both Type 1 and T2DM. This phenomenon has been attributed to intra-islet defects, like modifications in pancreatic α cell mass or dysfunction in glucagon’s secretion. Emerging evidence has shown that chronic hyperglycaemia provokes changes in the Langerhans’ islets cytoarchitecture, including α cell hyperplasia, pancreatic beta (β) cell dedifferentiation into glucagon-positive producing cells, and loss of paracrine and endocrine regulation due to β cell mass loss. Other abnormalities like α cell insulin resistance, sensor machinery dysfunction, or paradoxical ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) opening have also been linked to glucagon hypersecretion. Recent clinical trials in phases 1 or 2 have shown new molecules with glucagon-antagonist properties with considerable effectiveness and acceptable safety profiles. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) have been shown to decrease glucagon secretion in T2DM, and their possible therapeutic role in T1DM means they are attractive as an insulin-adjuvant therapy. © 2021 by the authors.

This research proposes a novel methodology to integrate electric vehicles and buses to optimise the tramway infrastructure. It is necessary to address challenges from the technical point of view by analysing the stochasticity of its variables through simulation in OpenDSS software. The technical feasibility of the tram power system and the impacts caused in the distribution network due to the incorporation of charging stations in three operating scenarios: the first in slow charging, the second in fast charging, and a third scenario that combines the previous two methods. The simulations determine that slow charging at night represents 9% of the total bus fleet, improving the utilisation factor of the tram system from 11% to 32%, whereas the fast and combined charging of vehicles and buses is not feasible due to the increase in losses in the system due to overloading in the network; however, the study validates the penetration of certain charging stations in the tramway network in a real case. © 2023 by the authors.","charging station; distribution network; electric movility; OpenDSS; tramway","Ecuador; electric vehicle; infrastructure; methodology; network design; software; stochasticity","Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE; Universitat Politècnica de València, UPV; Universidad de Cuenca","This work was developed under the auspices of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain), the University of Cuenca (Ecuador), and the Catholic University of Cuenca (Ecuador) with the support of the Tram of Cuenca Company.

On their websites, universities publish their academic offerings, their mission, their vision, their academic objectives, their achievements, their regulations, their news and all their university work. Hence, the importance of university websites is accessible. The accessibility of university websites has been evaluated several times in the past, but there is no work that has summarized all the evaluations performed to provide a general overview of the situation. Therefore, in this research we have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate, analyze, synthesize and interpret the accessibility results of university websites published in 42 papers that have been selected for this study. The methodology used in this SLR was that proposed in Kitchenham’s guidelines, which includes three stages: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. The results present the analysis and synthesis of the evaluations of 9,140 universities in 67 countries. Of these, 38,416 web pages, 91,421 YouTube videos and 28,395 PDF documents were evaluated. Manual methods, methods with automatic tools and the combination of both methods were used for the evaluation. Most websites were evaluated using the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 and Section 508 standards. The accessibility guidelines most commonly violated in the evaluations were: adaptable, compatible, distinguishable, input assistance, keyboard accessible, navigable, predictable, readable and text alternatives. In conclusion, the university websites, YouTube videos and PDF documents analyzed in the 42 papers present important accessibility problems. The main contribution of this SLR is the consolidation of the results of the 42 studies selected to determine the findings and trends in the accessibility of university websites around the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Evaluation; Systematic literature review; University; Web accessibility; Websites","ISO Standards; Analysis and synthesis; Evaluation; Manual methods; PDF document; Systematic literature review; University; University works; Web accessibility; Web-page; YouTube; Websites","Catholic University of Cuenca; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; European Commission, EC, (PID2019-111196RB-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Erasmus+, (609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP)","This work was supported by the Catholic University of Cuenca; the EduTech project (609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; and the project “Development of IoT systems for people with disabilities” (PID2019-111196RB-I00) of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

Our technique has the advantage of using images from mammograms and mesoscopic multiparticle collision MPC simulation, making it more affordable and easier to implement compared to other DWI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI. To create our simulation, we start with the region of interest from a mammogram where the lesion is located and build a flat simulation box with impenetrable cylindrical obstacles of varying diameters to represent the tissue’s heterogeneity. The volume of each obstacle is based on the intensity of the mammogram pixels, and the diffusion coefficient is calculated by simulating the behavior of a point particle fluid inside the box using MPC.

In this case, this robot responds to the need to achieve technological development in an emerging country with the aim of social impact and social interaction. There are two problems with the social robots currently on the market, which are the main focus of this research. First, their costs are not affordable for companies, universities, or individuals in emerging countries. The second is that their design is exclusively oriented to the functional part with a vision inherent to the engineers who create them without considering the vision, preferences, or requirements of the end users, especially for their social interaction. This last reason ends causing an aversion to the use of this type of robot. In response to the issues raised, a low-cost prototype is proposed, starting from a commercial platform for research development and using open source code. The robot design presented here is centered on the criteria and preferences of the end user, prioritizing acceptability for social interaction. This article details the selection process and hardware capabilities of the robot. Moreover, a programming section is provided to introduce the different software packages used and adapted for the social interaction, the main functions implemented, as well as the new and original part of the proposal.

With this, the demand for studies aiming at the discovery of new antibiotics or molecules that may play a synergistic role within the spectrum of drug-resistant bacteria is of fundamental importance. In this in silico study, ligands generated from anthraquinones with established antibacterial activity were evaluated as potential inhibitors of the DNA gyrase subunit B of two species of Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. The main result of molecular docking-based virtual screening reveals several anthraquinones with remarkable binding energies, of which 7,7′-bializarin (ZINC000004783172) exhibited the highest value for all DNA gyrases subunit B studied and formed stable complexes, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulations.

It is related to the presence of microorganisms and their metabolism, especially bacteria, which are involved in oxidizing compounds such as NH4+ and NO2− to NO3−. In this study, we evaluated the nitrification potential in 12 bacteria strains that belong to the genera Aeromonas, Bacillus, Buttiauxella, Mycobacterium, Paenibacillus, Serratia, and Yersenia, which are part of the cultivable microbial community from soil in a native forest and pine forest in The Labrado area within the Machangara micro-watershed in the Andes located in the south of Ecuador. This investigation aims to identify heterotrophic and lithoautotrophic strains using specific culture media for ammonium oxidative (AOL-AOH) and nitrate oxidation bacteria (ONL-ONH). The formation of nitrifying halos in the culture media allowed the identification of 10 strains with nitrifying potential. Five strains were from the pine forest, four were isolated from the native forest, and one strain was shared between both forests. The Serratia and Yersinia genera have a high NO2− oxidation capacity. Their inoculation in synthetic water rich in nitrogenous products allowed us to determine 40% and 94% nitrite reduction percentages and cell retention times of 20 to 40 days. Our results are promising for their possible potential use in environmental bioremediation processes through inoculation in wastewater for the biological removal of nitrogenous compounds. © 2023 by the authors.","Andean ecosystems; bacteria; bioremediation; nitrification","Andes; Ecuador; bacterium; bioremediation; forest soil; microbial community; nitrification; nitrite; nitrogen cycle; oxidation; soil ecosystem","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164181975"

Wind energy is one of the most profitable and accessible technologies in this sense, and among the alternatives to manage its variability is prediction, which has become an increasingly popular topic in academia. Currently, there are several methods used for prediction, the methods based on artificial neural networks (RNA) are the ones that have aroused the greatest research interest. In this sense, this study presents the training of different ML algorithms, using deep learning models for the prediction of the power generated by a wind turbine. In addition, a new filtered signal is generated from the wind signal that is integrated into the set of input signals, obtaining better training performance. These models include long-short-term memory (LSTM), recurring rental unit (GRU) cells, and a Transformers-based model.

Understanding slope failure mechanisms is complicated by the difficulty in directly measuring physical parameters during these events. However, active remote sensing, particularly interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), has become a crucial tool for detecting and characterizing slow-moving landslides over large areas. This research focuses on measuring the deformation associated with the catastrophic landslide that occurred in Alausí on March 26, 2023. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), utilizing the StaMPS algorithm, was applied to analyze deformation using ascending and descending Sentinel-1 time series data from 2021 to 2023. The study identifies two critical areas: Area A, corresponding to the leading scarp of the fatal landslide, and Area B, located approximately 1.3 km to the left of Area A, both of which belong to the same ancient scarp. The observed displacements in these areas exhibited average rates in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction for both ascending and descending orbits, as well as in the vertical and horizontal directions, ranging from one to two dozen millimeters per year. This data is invaluable for enhancing early warning systems and supporting post-disaster recovery efforts in the Andean region. Furthermore, the mapping of vertical and horizontal displacements allows for more accurate delineation of landslide boundaries and improved volume calculations, contributing to a clearer understanding of landslide dynamics. These insights are essential for developing more resilient communities and mitigating the risks posed by natural hazards. © 2024 SPIE.","Alausí; Ecuador; Landslide kinematics characterization; Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS)","Hydrogeology; Interferometry; Radar measurement; Radar warning systems; Tropics; Alausi; Andean Region; Ecuador; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Kinematic characterization; Landslide kinematic characterization; Multi-temporal; Persistent scatterers; Stanford; Stanford method for persistent scatterer; Landslides","4TU High Tech; University of Twente; Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE; Corporación Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigación y la Academia, CEDIA, (I+D+I-XVII-2023-08); Corporación Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigación y la Academia, CEDIA","We would like to express our gratitude to the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) of the University of Twente and the 4TU High Tech for a Sustainable Future Program DeSIRE for their support.

Scientific evidence has indicated that the possible link between obesity and psoriasis may be multifactorial, highlighting dietary habits, lifestyle, certain genetic factors and the microbiome as leading factors in the progress of both pathologies because they are associated with a chronic pro-inflammatory state. Thus, inflammation management in obesity is a plausible target for psoriasis, not only because of the sick adipose tissue secretome profile but also due to the relationship of obesity with the rest of the immune derangements associated with psoriasis initiation and maintenance. Hence, this review will provide a general and molecular overview of the relationship between both pathologies and present recent therapeutic advances in treating this problem. © 2022 by the authors.

It is very hard to find, has a low attack rate, and comes at a set time. Detection methods that have been used before have problems because they only use one type of detection and are not very good at identifying the object. In the end, a way to detect many sorts of minimal DDoS assaults that use deep hybrid learning is suggested. To construct multi-type limited DDoS threat data sets and mimic diverse sorts DDoS assaults and legitimate traffic in varying situations in the 5G setting, collect congestion at the networking entry and extract flow feature info are considered. From a statistical threshold and feature engineering point of view, these data sets show how many sorts of minimal DDoS assaults are there. This study aims to develop a deep hybrid learning-based multi-type low-rate DDoS attack detection solution for 5G networks which is the novel model that is recently deployed, and a hybrid deep learning algorithm was used to train the algorithm offline, and the algorithm's performance was compared to that of the LSTM-Light GBM and LSTM-RF algorithms. The CNN-RF revealing model was then used to detect minimal DDoS assaults at the gateway, so that multiple attacks could be detected at the same time. It can identify 4 sorts of low-rate DDoS assaults like Slow-Headers, Slow-Body, Slow-Read, and Shrew assaults, in a 120-second window. The false intercept rate is 11.03 percent. This means that 96.22 percent of traffic could be found. Using the strategy suggested can help cut down on the traffic concentration of minimal DDoS attacks at the net ingress. It can also be used in real-world situations.  © 2022 Harish Kumar et al.","","5G mobile communication systems; Denial-of-service attack; Gateways (computer networks); Long short-term memory; Network protocols; Network security; Adaptive mechanism; CNN models; Data set; DDoS Attack; Denialof- service attacks; Distributed denial of service; Hybrid learning; Low rates; Minimal degree; Networks services; Learning algorithms","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133389765"

The transition of energy systems in these countries is closely linked to policies and legislation that promote the adoption of renewable energy, guided by roadmaps that facilitate planning and decision-making processes. Transportation stands out as a crucial sector in these transition efforts, and support for renewable energy is already driving significant changes in several continents, albeit with different levels of impact. The analysis involved a review of 180 articles published in ScienceDirect since 2000, focused on renewable energy systems in Latin America. Among them, only 40 scientific articles were identified that specifically address electric mobility systems for mass transportation, such as trams and railways, that is environmentally friendly. Currently, their contribution in Latin America is only 1.7%, and it is expected that they will play a fundamental role in the energy transition in 2050, contributing 9.3% within the electrified transportation sector. The results of the research revealed that Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Colombia, and Costa Rica are the countries that have carried out the most high-impact research in relation to mobility systems with 100% renewable energy systems.

This computer security technique consists of creating a trap or decoy that pretends to be a valuable target for cybercriminals, such as, for example, important data, applications or web servers, among others. Once the attacker enters this environment, it records all the activities and behaviors performed by them, this in turn, allows the detection and proactive response to future attacks. Likewise, they allow to reduce false positives and identify vulnerabilities of the systems. On the other hand, the implementation of these tools implies a potential risk, because they can be used by attackers to obtain information about the defenses of the institution or organization and, even more, if it is not installed correctly, leaving the system and sensitive data exposed. In this sense, there are many high and low interaction Honeypots, such as, for example, Honeyd, Dioneda, Capture-HPC, KFSensor, INetSim. Cowrie, Honeytrap, Amun, Glastopf, Contop, among others. Finally, T-Pot Honeypot is considered as a set of computers (All in one) containing both high and low interaction Honeypots, with a unique ability to customize and manage honeypots, that is, it is a powerful and effective tool in the fight against attackers and computer security threats. In addition, it allows the obtaining of behavioral data of cybercriminals to later determine patterns that allow improving Web Security. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

However, traditional methods like mechanical current meters and hydroacoustic instruments face limitations in terms of cost, intrusiveness, and accessibility. In recent years, image-based velocimetry techniques have emerged as promising alternatives due to their non-contact nature and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, persistent challenges remain, particularly concerning the uniform distribution of surface tracers necessary for precise measurements. These challenges are particularly pronounced in cases involving artificial seeding, where ensuring uniform distribution poses a significant obstacle. To address this issue, this study presents a novel methodology for filtering Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) data based on indicators of pixel intensity gradients. The methodology was evaluated across various field measurements under low flow conditions, encompassing a wide range of seeding characteristics. The evaluations demonstrated improvements in mean surface velocity profile estimation, showing reductions of up to 70 % in normalized root mean square error compared to not using filters. Additionally, the results were compared with filters typically employed by experienced LSPIV users, such as background subtraction and cross-correlation coefficient thresholds, showing improvements with the proposed filter. Implementation of the proposed strategy reduces the subjectivity in LSPIV implementation, particularly for users with limited knowledge of the technique, but also require minimal post-processing efforts. The methodology is anticipated to be integrated into existing software tools, thereby enhancing the accessibility of LSPIV for individuals with limited expertise in image velocimetry. Overall, this methodology facilitates cost-effective expansion of hydrological information availability, particularly in resource-constrained regions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Flow velocity; Image gradient; Image velocimetry; LSPIV; Seeding distribution","Flow velocity; Velocimeters; Water management; Condition; Image gradients; Image velocimetry; Large scale particle image velocimetry; Large-scales; Low-speed flow; Particle images; Seeding distribution; Uniform distribution","Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE","We appreciate the funding from UCACUE within the PIC5P23-28 Research Project, thanks to this collaboration it was possible to have the equipment to measure the tributaries of Cuenca city.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205730070"

In this regard, it is true that light-emitting devices may vary in their physical characteristics and feeding requirements, and therefore, it is necessary to study and standardize their behavior in order to optimize treatments and ensure their efficacy and safety. In this context, it is important to have laboratory tools to measure and characterize medical devices used for the treatment of neonatal jaundice. In this case, a device capable of measuring the temperature, humidity and number of lumens of phototherapy lamps used for this purpose is mentioned. Such tools make it possible to assess the quality and efficacy of the lamps, identify possible failures, and make adjustments to improve their performance. In addition, the importance of having software to manage the device and review the results is mentioned. Such tools can be very useful in educational settings, as they allow students and teachers to access the data and results of the analyses performed with the device, which can facilitate the understanding of the principles and applications of phototherapy in neonatal jaundice. This work covers the standardization and characterization of medical devices used in the treatment of neonatal jaundice, which is essential to ensure their efficacy and safety.

This research seeks to improve the performance of wind turbines by designing and developing hybrid intelligent controllers that combine advanced artificial intelligence techniques. A control system combining deep neural networks and fuzzy logic was implemented to optimize the efficiency and operational stability of a 3.5 MW wind turbine. This study analyzed several deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN, ANN, and transformers) to predict the generated power, using data from the SCADA system. The structure of the hybrid controller includes a fuzzy inference system with 28 rules based on linguistic variables that consider power, wind speed, and wind direction. Experiments showed that the hybrid-GRU controller achieved the best balance between predictive performance and computational efficiency, with an R2 of 0.96 and 12,119.54 predictions per second. The GRU excels in overall optimization.

This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to evaluate the current state of research on organizational and financial resilience in SMEs. Fifty-one primary studies published between 2000 and 2023 were reviewed, using strict inclusion and quality evaluation criteria to ensure the relevance and robustness of the findings. The results revealed that only 5.88% of the evaluated studies rigorously followed SLR guidelines, highlighting the scarcity of comprehensive reviews in this field. This review also underscores that organizational resilience, encompassing both planned and adaptive dimensions, is essential for SMEs to respond effectively to financial and operational crises. However, few studies have focused specifically on the Ecuadorian context, indicating a gap in the literature that should be addressed more thoroughly. This study concludes that future research should adopt more holistic approaches that incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to develop models that strengthen resilience among SMEs.

Agriculture is a precious resource (asset), and problems with agriculture can lead to famine and migration crises that destabilize a society. Smart agriculture can increase productivity and crop yield with new operating and business models. Smart agriculture relies on information and communication technology (ICT). However, a cyberattack on a country's agricultural ICT can jeopardize an entire nation. In light of the aforementioned challenges and threats, this research presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to address the lack of a comprehensive review of the literature on cybersecurity in smart agriculture. This SLR analyzes 58 documents extracted from Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. The main findings on cybersecurity in smart agriculture encompass the challenges of cybersecurity in agriculture, the detection of attacks and intrusions, the evaluation of case studies, the assessment of frameworks, and the analysis of applied models. Organizations should also train their employees to recognize and respond to cyber threats. In addition, organizations should invest in cybersecurity processes, equipment, and training. The main contribution of this SLR is the consolidation of results to identify research findings, research gaps, and trends in cybersecurity in smart agriculture. The intended audience for this article includes researchers, farmers, and agribusinesses who may utilize frameworks, models, case studies, or emerging technologies in smart agriculture with the objective of mitigating or preventing cybersecurity threats. © 2024 The Authors","Agriculture; Cybersecurity; Frameworks; Models; Smart agriculture; Systematic literature review; Threats","Agribusiness; 'current; Case-studies; Crop yield; Cyber security; Framework; Future challenges; Information and Communication Technologies; Smart agricultures; Systematic literature review; Threat; Smart agriculture","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212842638"

To do this, the regulatory bodies in charge of environmental surveillance, protection and prevention use air quality measurement systems in the form of fixed stations located in areas of interest, generating high investment costs due to the need to replicate instrumentation systems at strategic points for data collection. Taking into account the above, this project presents an alternative solution to the problem posed by instrumenting an unmanned aerial vehicle as a displacement device and implementing a measurement system for environmental variables anchored to it. As a result, the air quality measurement system was obtained using low-cost sensors mounted on a drone. From the data obtained from the real-time system, it was possible to establish that the parameters evaluated are within the norm established for our country. It was also determined that in the area near the cement factory, the average particulate matter is 8.01 μg/m3 and carbon dioxide of 373.26 ppm, in relation to the center of Guapán with values of 6.34 μg/m3 and 158.45 ppm, respectively, therefore, the levels of contamination near the company are higher than those measured in the parish center. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Air quality; Environmental; Monitoring; Pollutants; System","Antennas; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Costs; Health risks; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Air quality measurements; Developed countries; Environmental; Environmental pollutions; Human health; Measurement system; Pollutant; Regulatory bodies; System; World Health Organization; Air quality","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174703570"

Therefore, an automatic control system is needed, connected to a single phase solar power system, to automatically switch the phase of the grid distribution and improve the voltage drop levels in low voltage by taking real-time electric data. This work conducts a test on a prototype of an Automatic Phase switch (APS), which can select the optimal phase of a two- phase system with an imbalance, intending to improve the voltage profile. An exhaustive study was conducted on the logic of operation and the topology of the APS, followed by the development of the algorithm that manages the connections of the APS to the grid, based on precise data on voltage, current flow, power, and imbalance. Additionally, an interface was developed for a basic SCADA system in Matlab, allowing the visualization of the measured variables. The connections of the APS to the biphasic grid were made using off-grid and on-grid inverters in different configurations. The limitation of a biphasic inverter was also addressed by testing the switching of both the output of the inverter and the input of the APS, to ensure that the voltages were in phase to avoid short circuits. The APS system is an interface that improves the balance of the grid and achieves better performance through a SCADA system. © 2024 IEEE.","algorithm; APS; automatic control; SCADA; unbalanced networks","Automation; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric switches; Power quality; Process control; SCADA systems; Automatic control systems; Automatic phase switch; Decentralised; Phase distribution; Phase switch; Photovoltaic energy; SCADA; Two phase; Unbalanced network; Voltage imbalance; Solar energy","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199449474"

In addition, urban morphology can also contribute to the increase in temperature in cities. The UHI effect can be described as an urban climate that is generally characterized by higher temperatures in densely built-up areas compared to surrounding areas. This effect impacts the environmental stress of the city and directly affects the health and quality of life of its inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate resources to understand the UHI mechanism in cities in order to propose appropriate mitigation measures that will reduce energy consumption and improve living conditions. In this context, this research was aimed at analyzing the behavior of urban heat islands by replacing asphalt with cool paving materials (concrete) in roadways. Through computer simulations, using the ENVI-met software, the thermal variations of urban heat islands were examined. The city of Cuenca (Ecuador) was selected as the study area. The day of the analysis was 22 January 2020, which was recorded as the warmest day of the year, registering an average temperature of 16 °C. The findings of this research evidenced that, by replacing asphalt pavements with concrete pavements in the analyzed zones, land surface temperature (LST) could be reduced by 8 °C and the global LST of the studied areas could be reduced by approximately 3 °C. Consequently, the mean air temperature of the study areas reflected a decrease of up to 0.83 °C. © 2022 by the authors.","computer models; cool pavements; Cuenca; Ecuador; mitigation; urban heat island","Cuenca [Azuay]; Ecuador; environmental stress","Catholic University of Cuenca, (UCACUE-JIEI-2021-241-OF)","This project was funded by Catholic University of Cuenca by funding number UCACUE-JIEI-2021-241-OF.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137181272"

The concept of automation must be implemented to carry out the planning, operation, and optimization processes of the behavior of the distribution networks. Thanks to this development, since 2004, the implementation of the simulation and the CYMDIST modeling system in Ecuador's electrical companies has been possible; nevertheless, with certain dynamic limitations in real-time. Therefore, this document presents the development of an interface that integrates the RT-LAB real-time simulation software to the CYMDIST environment, using the 34 node IEEE model. This proposed integration model will allow evaluating and validating the correct communication between the computer packages and examining the behavior of the proposed system under certain test scenarios that guarantee optimal performance by performing a load flow analysis that provides magnitude and angle values both in voltage and current. The results obtained were very close in levels of precision of the model, and it can be appreciated employing the proposed graphical interface.

Deploying large-scale wireless charging infrastructures to charge electric transit buses when loading and unloading passengers have become an effective way to reduce emissions. The standard plug-in electric vehicles have a limited amount of power stored in the battery, resulting in frequent stops to refill the energy. Optimal siting of wireless charging bus stops is essential to reducing these inconveniences and enhancing the sus-tainability performance of a wireless charging bus fleet. Wireless charging is an innovation of trans-mitting power through electromagnetic induction to portable electrical devices for energy renewal. Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV) is a new technology that allows the vehicle to be charged while it is in motion, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. Developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), OLEV picks up electricity from power transmitters buried underground. This paper aims to investigate the cost of the energy logistics for the three types of wireless charging networks: stationary wireless charging (SWC), quasi-dynamic wireless charging (QWC), and dynamic wireless charging (DWC), deployed at stops and size of battery capacity for electric buses, using OLEV technology for a bus service transit in the borough of Manhat-tan (MN) in New York City (NYC). © 2021 by the authors.

This study was intended to investigate the enhancement effect and characteristics of nanofluids; Al2O3, CuO, Fe3O4 and SiO2 on the performance the hybrid system composed of PV Thermal, ORC and cooling coil. The quaternary refrigerant mixture used in the ORC cycle to enhance the ORC efficiency is an environmentally sound refrigerant mixture composed of R152a, R245fa, R125, and R1234fy. It was shown that the enhancement of the efficiency of the hybrid system in question is significantly dependent upon not only the solar radiation but also the nanofluids concentration and the type of nanofluid as well as the fluid temperature driving the ORC. A higher hybrid system efficiency has been overserved with nanofluid CuO. Moreover, it has been also shown that on the average, the hybrid system efficiency was higher 17% with nanofluid CuO compared to water as the heat transfer fluid. In addition, it was also observed that the higher cooling effect produced is significantly increased with the use of the nanofluid CuO compared to the other nanofluids under investigation and water as heat transfer fluid.

It was based on several methodological procedures: documentary research and descriptive research, using a SIPOC procedure and a cause-effect diagram to determine the various relationships that occur in the management process under assessment. Among the results, a characterization of the processes was obtained that are carried out and a list of the causes that affect the weaknesses of the management on university processes. One of the most important was the staff training element, weaknesses in leadership and lack of strategic planning, as well as inadequacies in the applications implemented for the automation in processes and a low sense of belonging by the staff, whose performance does not show commitment to the organization.

We describe the collective behavior of a model of globally coupled robust-chaos maps in terms of statistical quantities and characterize clusters, chimera states, synchronization, and incoherence on the space of parameters of the system. We employ the analogy between the local dynamics of a system of globally coupled maps with the response dynamics of a single driven map. We interpret the occurrence of clusters and chimeras in a globally coupled system of robust-chaos maps in terms of windows of periodicity and multistability induced by a drive on the local robust-chaos map. Our results show that robust-chaos dynamics does not limit the formation of cluster and chimera states in networks of coupled systems, as it had been previously conjectured. © 2021 M. G.

Support vector machines (SVM) through regression approach (SVR), constitute an artificial intelligence method to downscaling climatic variables. Since that statistical downscaling based on regression methodologies is susceptible to the predictor variables, the aim of this study was exploring a big database of predictor variables to achieve the best performance of a statistical downscaling model using SVR to predict precipitation and temperature future projections. Data from regional climate models of Ecuador and information of three meteorological stations was used to apply this approach in the Tomebamba river sub-basin, located in southern Ecuadorian Andean region. The results show that the downscaling model has a better performance with the climatic averages. The precipitation extremes do not estimate in a good manner, but the model achieves an effective behavior with the temperature extremes values. These results could serve to improve water balance projections in the future for formulating suitable measures for climate change decision-making. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Andean basin; Artificial intelligence; Climate big data; Climate change; Statistical downscaling; SVR","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Climate models; Decision making; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Water resources; Andean basin; Artificial intelligence methods; Meteorological station; Precipitation extremes; Regional climate models; Statistical downscaling; Support vector regression (SVR); Water resources planning and managements; Climate change","Ecuadorian Corporation; University of Cuenca","Funding.

These events motivate several research and debates in the scientific community to try to explain the transformations of urban behavior in different aspects, including the weakness of streets networks. This paper presents a study of the impact of an adverse event in the transport infrastructure in a city. Precisely, we represent the transport infrastructure of a city thanks to a graph. This graph is analyzed using some measures like as the degree of connectivity, the density, and the intermediate centrality. Later, three kinds of attacks on the network were implemented, i.e., nodes of the network were systematically eliminated, and the characteristics of the network were re-measured. The idea behind is to measure - for instance - if a health center can still be accessible when the routes that allow access to the center are closed due to an adverse event (e.g., an earthquake). Two cities of two countries in South-America have been compared in different granularity levels.

Therefore, this research aims to create a process model for continuous web accessibility testing by adapting and customizing three methodologies: Deming cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act), Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM), and Total Quality Management. The process model is composed of four phases. The first phase (Plan) allows defining the accessibility problem, its importance, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) against which it will be evaluated. In addition, determine the current situation of the websites, the potential causes of accessibility problems, classify the success criteria by principles, guidelines, and levels of conformity, to elaborate the solution plan and the action plan. The second phase (Do) allows the execution of the action plan to correct the accessibility problems. In this phase, we should perform continuous testing with automatic evaluation tools, end-users, and experts to corroborate that the changes have had an effect. The third phase (Check) allows measuring compliance and non-compliance with the defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This phase also explains the reasons for non-compliance. The fourth and last phase (Act) documents the solutions learned for inclusion in future developments. This research results in the process model for continuous web accessibility and its testing through a case study to corroborate its functionality and applicability. In conclusion, the proposed model allows continuous evaluation, monitoring, and feedback on compliance with accessibility rules, policies, and standards on websites with automatic evaluation tools, end-users, and experts. We plan to adapt the process model to different workgroups in future work, such as developing accessible mobile applications and producing accessible electronic documents.  © 2013 IEEE.","continuous testing; Deming cycle; total quality management; WCAG; WCAG-EM; web accessibility; websites","Benchmarking; Compliance control; Quality control; Software testing; Adaptation models; Continuous testing; Deming cycle; Guideline; Process-models; Software testings; Web accessibility; Web content accessibility guideline-EM; Web content accessibility guidelines; Websites","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116883148"

The main purpose of the proposed approach is to evaluate low-cost automation solutions (hardware and software) within the framework of modern industry requirements in order to determine whether these technologies could be enabling factors of IIoT. The proposed control strategy for regulating tank levels combines the classic PID algorithm and the fuzzy gain scheduling PID (FGS-PID) approach. Fault detection capabilities are also enabled for the system through a fault detection and diagnosis module (FDD) implemented with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The distributed controller's (DC) algorithms are embedded into the PLC's processors in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed system.

Although to some extent electricity losses are inevitable, effective actions must be sought to solve this problem, to reduce both technical and non-technical losses. Consequently, this article proposes a system for measuring the caliber of power lines through the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and computer vision. This system will be a tool to decrease technical losses. At present, the caliber measurement is carried out subjectively. An operator or electrical technician by means of his expertise and a visual examination measures the wire gauge without a tool. This causes outdated global information systems, resulting in poor electrical planning. The proposed system focuses on flight control of the UAV, detection of objects using a mask of convolutional neural networks, distance estimation, and caliber measurement of aerial power lines without contact. The system reliability is high, with a concordance correlation (r = 0.97) between the measurements made with a manual meter and the UAV. Therefore, the proposed system improves data quality, reduces time and costs, and minimizes the risk of accidents. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aerial power line inspection; Aerial power line measurement; Computer vision; UAV; Wire gauge","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Electric industry; Electric losses; Gages; Object detection; Power generation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Distance estimation; Electric power industries; Global information systems; Non-technical loss; Power line inspections; Power lines; Visual examination; Wire gauges; Electric power system measurement","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082386037"

This study is intended to investigate the enhancement effect and characteristics of nanofluids Al2 O3, CuO, Fe3 O4 and SiO2 in integrated concentrating solar power (CSP) with ORC, and TES under different solar radiations, angles of incidence, and different nanofluid concentrations. The refrigerant mixture used in the ORC loop to enhance the ORC efficiency is an environmentally sound quaternary mixture composed of R134a, R245fa, R125, R236fa. The results showed that the power absorbed, and power collected by the CSP collector and thermal energy stored in the storage tank are enhanced with the increase of the solar radiation. It was also found that the CSP hybrid system efficiency has been enhanced mainly by the increase of the solar radiation and higher nanofluid concentrations over the thermal oil as base fluid. Also, the study concludes that the nanofluid CuO outperforms the other nanofluids—Al2 O3, Fe3 O4 and SiO2 —and has the highest CSP solar collector performance compared to the other nanofluids and thermal oil base fluid under study at similar conditions. Finally, it was found that the model’s prediction compares fairly with data reported in the literature; however, some discrepancies exist between the model’s prediction and the experimental data. © 2019 by the author.

In this way, anyone can consult information of interest, assimilate it and turn it into useful knowledge. However, in recent years this new technological trend has driven users to generate a large amount of personal content, leaving aside any quality index, which translates into a new social problem known as information overload, infoxication or infobesity. The contact with information that is constantly increasing and of which validity has not been proven can cause difficulties, from the assimilation of knowledge to psychological disorders (anguish). The educational field is no stranger to this situation, as students use technology to support their academic processes. This research proposes the development of an experts recommendation tool (individuals who significantly manage a topic of interest) based on Twitter and Mendeley with a semi-supervised approach. In a Web application, keywords related to a topic of interest are entered and extracted from potential Mendeley experts, and then their accounts are located on Twitter. With this information, a user validates whether the Twitter profiles correspond to experts and authorizes the publication of a recommendation to students. With the semi-supervised approach, the accuracy of the recommendations is 100%, so the results obtained are promising. © 2018 IEEE.","Expert recommendation; Information overload; Mendeley; Social networking; Twitter","Data mining; Engineering education; Students; Expert recommendations; Information and Communication Technologies; Information overloads; Mendeley; Psychological disorders; Technological trends; Twitter; Web 2.0 Technologies; Social networking (online)","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070945006"

The least significant bit (LSB) method consists in replacing the last bit of each byte and can do it in several bytes at the same time and the image will not have a noticeable change. Each substituted bit is part of a letter of the message that you want to hide in the given image. In general, images with PGM extension are very useful to apply the technique (LSB) since they are images whose content is given without following some algorithm of compression; This means that the content of the file is more readable and easy to work since it is in the ascci format (US standard code for information exchange). The content of an image with PGM extension, can be visualized using a simple text editor, so that the ASCII information can be seen as a representation of whole numbers, the value of these numbers will represent the intensity of color, 255 is white and 0 is black. If each row of the matrix represents an image data and every last digit, which is the least significant bit, is altered, then the eight bits corresponding to each altered byte would represent a letter belonging to a hidden message word. If this sequence is repeated several times you can hide more information such as phrases or sentences. Steganography is a useful tool in the field of computer security where it is required to verify that private information is correctly used by the user determined using the encryption in the personal key. There are already several software products that are responsible for carrying out this process, one of these cases is OpenStego, which encrypts the information using steganography and through passwords ensures that only the bearer of it will be able to visualize said information. We will show that the use of the Fortran, MatLab programming language presents great advantages for steganography since access to memory spaces through pointers allows freeing up memory at runtime, which provides a high degree of efficiency in the execution of a Program. Fortran, being a programming language oriented to mathematical calculation in general, has tools that facilitate its application and expressly the matrix calculation used in steganography. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cybersecurity; Encryption; Information; Key; LSB; PGM; Steganography","","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112301949"

Thus, taking into consideration the difficulties faced by the elderly, States implement social security programs that seek to support their development. Ecuador follows this trend and presents proposals that address a number of fundamental rights, which are considered priority health care services. Although the measures implemented maintain the health, this reality changes when moving from an urban to a rural scenario. This is justified by the fact that in Ecuador, specialists who care for the elderly constantly change their location and, therefore, their patients, rather than maintaining a non-standardized data record on paper, causing inefficiency and waste of time.

The results showed that academic performance is not linked to alcohol consumption at the end or midweek. Free days have no relation to performance. For the case of gender it seems to be better that women have a university preparation to achieve a better score. In relation to health, women are more affected with absences. Finally, if there is a relationship between internet access and performance. The results of this work are not conclusive, they are only the first notes to determine and corroborate the influence of academic and social variables in the academic score. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Influence; Score; Variables","Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Data mining; E-learning; Students; Virtual reality; Academic performance; Alcohol consumption; Influence; Level of educations; Score; Student performance; Variables; Virtual learning environments; Knowledge management","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067671153"

The proposed model was established after the mass and energy conservation equations written for finite control volume were integrated with properties of the water and nanofluids. The nanofluids studied and presented herein are Ai2O3, CuO, Fe3O4, and SiO2 . The multiple flashing chamber process was studied under various conditions, including different solar radiation levels, brine flows and concentrations, and nanofluid concentrations as well as flashing chamber temperatures and pressures. Solar radiation levels were taken as 500 w/m2, 750 w/m2, 1000 w/m2, and finally, 1200 w/m2 . The nanofluid volumetric concentrations considered varied from 1% to 20%. There is clear evidence that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the flashed flow produced. The results also clearly show that irreversibility is reduced by using nanofluid Ai2O3 at higher concentrations of 10% to 20% compared to water as base fluid. The highest irreversibility was experienced when water was used as base fluid and the lowest irreversibility was associated with nanofluid SiO2 . The irreversibility increase depends upon the type of nanofluid and its thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the higher the concentration (e.g., from 10% to 20% of Ai2O3), the higher the availability at the last flashing chamber. However, the availability is progressively reduced at the last flashing chamber. Finally, the predicted results compare well with experimental data published in the literature. © 2020 by the author.

When we talk about web accessibility, we refer to a web design and development that allows these people to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web. Web accessibility also benefits other people, including elderly people whose abilities have declined as a result of age. The Web is an essential resource in human activity: education, employment, government, commerce, health, entertainment and many others benefit of the power of the Web. The aim of this systematic literature review is to analyze the empirical methods of evaluating accessibility to educational websites, disabilities and their errors described in a total of 25 selected studies. The results show that in 20 of the 25 papers, web accessibility was evaluated with automatic tools, in 2 papers it was evaluated with real users and in the other 3 papers with automatic tools, real users and experts. There is also evidence that all the educational websites analyzed in the papers need to correct errors. In conclusion, educational websites do not meet any version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and their conformance levels. According to the results, the empirical evaluation methods used for web accessibility could be improved by adopting automatic evaluation tools for website construction and manual mechanisms with web accessibility experts. The challenge for educational institutions is to carry out web accessibility projects to comply with WCAG and other web accessibility standards and current laws of educational inclusion. © 2013 IEEE.","Assessment; Education; Systematic literature review; Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG); Web page design; Websites","Paper; Systematic errors; Automatic evaluation tool; Educational institutions; Educational websites; Empirical evaluations; Systematic literature review; Web accessibility; Web content accessibility guidelines; Web design and development; Websites","Catholic University of Cuenca; European Commission, EC, (609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); European Commission, EC","This work was supported in part by the Catholic University of Cuenca and in part by the EduTech Project co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union under Grant 609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085546496"

However, user behavior on the platform remains an unknown, and indeed, little research has been conducted into whether resources within the course are actually used properly. Knowing what the characteristics and behavior of students are within the platform allows for changes to be made to existing courses, thus increasing their acceptance, improving the learning experience and helping to achieve the learning outcomes. Therefore, the use of Google Analytics (GA) is proposed to monitor student activity in MOOC, allowing for modeling the behavior of students. This article presents a study that analyzes the behavior of 18,677 students, distributed amongst 10 MOOC. This study analyzed demographic data, metrics according to the number of sessions, Internet connection speed and browsers used, among others. Once the student behavior is analyzed via GA, changes can be made to components and resources of MOOC and, thus increase the assent of students. © 2019 IEEE.","data analytics; Google Analytics; MOOC","Behavioral research; Information systems; Information use; Students; Web services; Demographic data; Google Analytics; Infinite numbers; Internet connection; Learning experiences; Learning outcome; Massive open online course; Student behavior; E-learning","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083463623"

Dentists are health professionals who are exposed to harmful noises from equipment in their clinics and may suffer hearing loss. This research seeks to prove if the persistent high-frequency sounds produced by dental equipment could cause hearing decrement among dental students during the fifth semester of their studies. The present study was conducted on 70 students from the Faculty of Odontology belonging to the Academic Unit of Health and Welfare at the University of Cuenca in their fifth cycle during the second semester 2016–2017. In a soundproofed room, audiometry was done on ten students per day through the application “hearing test” by Marcin Malaski, 1.1.3 version. Based on studies, they revealed that 40% of the students who did not have any hearing loss started to experience some form of hearing impairment. The 10% of students that had a mild hearing loss reached a moderate hearing loss. In the case of gender, 5% of male students changed their hearing level from a mild hearing loss to a moderate after their clinic activities. Among women 1.18% it had expressed a change from a mild hearing loss to a moderate. According to the project results, the noise exposure for five or six months in university dental clinic may cause hearing impairments. Therefore, it is highly recommended the use of hearing protectors for students as well as teachers. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Clinic; Hearing loss; Mobile health; Noise; Turbine","Dental equipment; Dentistry; mHealth; Noise pollution; Students; Turbines; Clinic; Health professionals; Hearing impairments; Hearing loss; High-frequency sounds; Noise; Physical conditions; University students; Audition","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076521704"

However, the victims that are found by robots do not have their vital signs evaluated until the rescue team reaches their location. This can complicate matters in difficult-to-access locations and places affected by toxic waste or radiation, where the physical integrity of rescue teams is at risk. This research proposes the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle in the search for victims and performing basic triage (heart and respiratory rate measurement) through a contactless method to support rescue efforts. The main contribution is a decrease in response time in case of a search-and-rescue emergency. The system consists of navigating over a certain area designated as the disaster zone for the search of possible disaster victims that are lying on the ground. Once the victim is located, the navigation is reprogrammed to carry out the search and face recognition. Finally, by automatically selecting a skin area, the heart and respiratory rates are measured. The measurement is carried out through the photoplethysmography imaging technique, without any contact sensor. The comparison of the basic triage results with and without contact confirms to us the efficacy of the proposed method. The Bland-Altman data analysis shows a close correlation of heart and respiratory rates measured with both approaches (correlation coefficient of 0.90 for heart rate and 0.84 for respiratory rate). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Photoplethysmography imaging; Recue UAV; Search and rescue; Triage UAV; Vital signs","Antennas; Disasters; Face recognition; Heart; Imaging techniques; Photoplethysmography; Robots; Toxic materials; Contactless methods; Correlation coefficient; Natural disasters; Physical integrity; Respiratory rate; Robotic systems; Search and rescue; Vital sign; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082393413"

The software architecture defines and designs the holistic structure that the software will have, its components, the interaction between them and all the development is done around it. The purpose of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to analyse the software architectures used in educational websites, methodologies, technological components and empirical results. The search of the SLR yielded 23 studies from the most significant academic sources in education and software engineering. The results of the SLR show that the analysed educational websites were proposing a software architecture, developing a system, proposing a model, assessing of a platform, proposing a Folksonomy-Based Ontology Maintenance, reviewing smart home design, and proposing a Web-based platform to aid parallel, distributed and high-performance computing education. Of the 23 selected studies, 13 carried out an evaluation of their research with either students, teachers, professionals or a combination of these. In conclusion, the selected studies present narrated experiments of projects or individuals that seek to improve collaborative learning in the educational area. Finally, an important finding is that the proposed software architectures do not contemplate laws or quality standards for universal access. © 2021 The Authors.

It is important that the measurements are taken in a non-invasive manner, which is imperceptible to the patient. Currently, many methods have been proposed for non-contact measurement. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it has not been possible to identify methods with low computational costs and a high tolerance to artifacts. With the aim of improving contactless measurement results, the proposed method based on the computer vision technique is enhanced to overcome the mentioned drawbacks. The camera is attached to an incubator in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a single area in the neonate’s diaphragm is monitored. Several factors are considered in the stages of image acquisition, as well as in the plethysmographic signal formation, pre-filtering and filtering. The pre-filter step uses numerical analysis techniques to reduce the signal offset. The proposed method decouples the breath rate from the frequency of sinus arrhythmia. This separation makes it possible to analyze independently any cardiac and respiratory dysrhythmias. Nine newborns were monitored with our proposed method. A Bland-Altman analysis of the data shows a close correlation of the heart rates measured with the two approaches (correlation coefficient of 0.94 for heart rate (HR) and 0.86 for breath rate (BR)) with an uncertainty of 4.2 bpm for HR and 4.9 for BR (k = 1). The comparison of our method and another non-contact method considered as a standard independent component analysis (ICA) showed lower central processing unit (CPU) usage for our method (75% less CPU usage). © 2018 by the authors.
